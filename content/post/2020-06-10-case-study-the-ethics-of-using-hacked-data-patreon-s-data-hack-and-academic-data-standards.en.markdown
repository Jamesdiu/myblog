I have read an interesting article from my online course recently. It is about whether we should use the hacked data. ( Here is the article [The Ethics of Using Hacked Data](https://bdes.datasociety.net/council-output/case-study-the-ethics-of-using-hacked-data-patreons-data-hack-and-academic-data-standards/). ) In short, there was a research team, which found the data they failed to obtain from the provider, was hacked and released to public, along with some other private or personal data. Then a discussion started on whether it is appropriate to use the hacked data. The ethical issue is a major concern. Finally, although more workload would be required to obtain the data in another source, the team decided not to use the hacked data. 

It is no doubt that this hacked data is very tempted, especially when it is difficult to obtain. Everyone who ever tried to collect data would understand the difficulties and pain in the process. It would be great to have these time-consuming tasks done by someone else. However, what is the trade-off? We all know there is rarely a free meal in the world. They always come along with some unexpected costs, which is not necessarily something from our wallet. For example, many people may already realize that trying their luck with those 'free' lotteries is equivalent to giving out their personal information in exchange with a low chance opportunity. It is possible that we will pay much more than we expected for the free meal. So what are we possibly paying for using the hacked data? How much could it be?

Encouraging hacking would be the first thing in my mind. Using these data is somehow supporting those hackers and agreeing to what they have done. Perhaps some hackers have a sublime reason, but it should not be an appropriate behavior to be encouraged. Luckily we are not the victim this time, but no one can be sure who will be the next. Secondly, since these data are not released officially, it is hard to guarantee its validity. It is possible that the hacker would mix some noise or distraction with the data. So how can we prove something with untrustful data? It seems to contradict the intention that using data to reveling the fact.
