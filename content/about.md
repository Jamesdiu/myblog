Hello! I am James from Hong Kong. I am currently living in Munich, a wonderful city I stay coincidentally. Starting this blog is another coincidence: One day I was watching some videos about how to use and get familiar with R. I found `Blogdown`. Then, here I am. 

Practicing is the main purpose of this blog, no matter for handling R, writing or reporting skills, or any other thing that is possible to practice within this blog. Perhaps some notes, tips, or experience through learning will also be included. I am not used to be a blogger, but I hope I will do it better and better in the future.
